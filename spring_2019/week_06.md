## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> We have tried to make the different page views for the app, so that we can access each view separately. \
> We also have made the app icons for the apple home screen, the apple store and notifications.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week, we want to fix the page views issue that we are having. \
> We currently have 4 page views (News, Schedule, Standings, Stats), but we need to code so that we have the 4 page views. \
> Once we add the page views, we will add to the UI and code.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> We have been having trouble making the page views.

## Notes
