## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Last week, I worked on trying to code the backend of a table in Standings.  I'm having some trouble getting it to work.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> I'm going to continue to debug and try and get the table to work and display what I want it to.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> The code is bugging and crashing for no reason that is apparant to me.  Hopefully, I can find the source.

## Notes

> The code is so simple that it's concerning that the execution is so buggy
