## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Last week, I finished the first section of the backend for Standings. Right now, I have the information hardcoded in.\
> This was so I could figure out the formatting of the information.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Now that I have the formatting and information figured out, I'm going to parse through the html string and grab the information.\
> Then, I'll populate the table with the information from the string and remove the hardcoded information.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> No blockers this week.

## Notes

> I think now that I have a feel for how to write the backend and fill with the information.
